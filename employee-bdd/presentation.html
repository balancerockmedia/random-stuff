                <h2>Test Driven Development</h2>
                
                <p>A software development technique that uses short cycles to incrementally design and develop software from the outside in</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write a test that shows the intent of what you would like the new code to do</li>
                    <li>Write the code to make the test pass</li>
                    <li>Refactor if needed to make it better</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Why write tests first?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forces you to think about the code before writing it</li>
                    <li>Helps prevent from over-engineering the solution</li>
                    <li>Write only the code that you need</li>
                    <li>Reduces the ownership that any one developer has on a section of code</li>
                    <li>Leads to better code coverage and less regressions</li>
                    <li>Sometimes you can't write tests first and that's ok</li>
                </ul>

                <p>"Many software projects suffer from low-quality communication between the domain experts and programmers on the team"</p>

                    <li>Merges TDD with automated acceptance testing</li>
                    <li>A common language is needed to express the acceptance tests in a way that the stakeholder and the developer understand</li>
                    <li>Similar to how a domain model can help everybody to understand the business objects</li>
                    <li>Acceptance tests written as examples of the functionality that everybody can understand</li>
                    <li>They become the living documentation</li>
                    <li>Broken down into features, scenarios and steps</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Command line tool that was first built for Ruby, but now has support for many other languages including JavaScript</li>
                <li>Reads specifications from plain-language text files called features, examines them for scenarios to test, and then runs the scenarios against your system</li>
                <li>Can be easily tied into build tools such as Grunt and Jenkins</li>

Feature: Sign up
  Sign up should be quick and friendly.
    
  Scenario: Successful sign up
    
    New users should get a confirmation email and be 
    greeted personally by the site once signed in.
        
      Given I have chosen to sign up
      When I sign up with valid details
      Then I should receive a confirmation email
      And I should see a personalized greeting message

    When I can change their title to "senior associate"
